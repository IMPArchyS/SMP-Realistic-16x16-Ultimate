Thanks for downloading. I will continually post my updates on Something Awful, the Minecraft forums and World of Minecraft. 

Come play on my server some time (or any WoM server).

These textures will only work for the current /indev/ build. The main texture file layout has changed since .30, so it will not work in creative yet. There is a version on my site that works for creative.

[Installation Instructions]

1. Go to your start menu. Next, find the program “Run”. This is usually found in the “Accessories” folder in your start menu.

2. Enter “%temp%” in the box that pops up and press enter.

3. This will bring up an explorer window that has a lot of folders. Find the one named “www.minecraft.net” or “minecraft.net”. If these folders do not appear, go to the official Minecraft site and launch the game. This will download the files into the %temp% folder. Open the folder.

4. There will be 1-3 folders in the “minecraft.net” folder. One is simply “Minecraft”, in there are the files for default creative mode. Another might be “Minecraft_sneakpeek”, these are the files for /indev/. The last may be “creeper_test”, these files are for the Survival mode sneak peek. Open whichever game mode you are trying to edit.

5. Inside your selected folder, there will be a file named “minecraft.jar”. You will need to open up the file (not extract!) with WinRAR or 7zip.

6. OPTIONAL. If your new skin came as a .rar, you will need to unrar it to someplace.

7. Insert the downloaded files into the .jar. To do this, simply drag and drop the files into the WinRAR/7zip window.

You’re done! Just go to the site and play like normal. However, if a new update is released, it will remove your textures. You will have to stick them back in the new (updated) minecraft.jar
