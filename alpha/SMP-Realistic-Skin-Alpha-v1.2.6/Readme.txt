Thanks for downloading. I will continually post my updates on Something Awful, the Minecraft forums and World of Minecraft. 

Come play on WoM sometime!

Included in this download, is both the indev/infdev and creative mode versions. The creative files can be found in the folder named "Creative".

[Installation Instructions]

Option 1: Edit minecraft.jar

1. The .jar file is located at

C:\Documents and Settings\[USERNAME]\Application Data\.minecraft\bin

2. Right click minecraft.jar and open it up with whatever zip program you use (WinRAR, 7zip, etc.)

3. Do the same for the .zip of the texture pack you downloaded. If the creator packaged it right, you should just be able drag and drop all the files into the other. Select every file in the texture pack zip, then drag/drop them into minecraft.jar

4. Load up the game via the site or the downloadable client!

Note: Any time there is an update, it will redownload minecraft.jar, so you have to redo this process.
